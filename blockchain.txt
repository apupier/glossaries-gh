double-spending
    The risk that a digital currency can be
    spent twice.
    
    It is a potential problem unique to
    digital currencies because digital
    information can be reproduced relatively
    easily by savvy individuals who understand
    the blockchain network and the computing
    power necessary to manipulate it.

State channels
    Refer to the process in which users
    transact with one another directly outside
    of the blockchain, or 'off-chain,' and
    greatly minimize their use of 'on-chain'
    operations.

Layer 2
    A secondary framework or protocol that is
    built on top of an existing blockchain
    system.

    The main goal of these protocols is to
    solve the transaction speed and scaling
    difficulties that are being faced by the
    major cryptocurrency networks.
