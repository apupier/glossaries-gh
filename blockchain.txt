State channels
    Refer to the process in which users
    transact with one another directly outside
    of the blockchain, or 'off-chain,' and
    greatly minimize their use of 'on-chain'
    operations.

Layer 2
    A secondary framework or protocol that is
    built on top of an existing blockchain
    system.

    The main goal of these protocols is to
    solve the transaction speed and scaling
    difficulties that are being faced by the
    major cryptocurrency networks.
