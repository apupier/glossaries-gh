crossover
recombination
    A genetic operator used to combine the
    genetic information of two parents to
    generate new offspring.
    
    It is one way to stochastically generate
    new solutions from an existing population,
    and analogous to the crossover that
    happens during sexual reproduction in
    biology.
    
    Solutions can also be generated by cloning
    an existing solution, which is analogous
    to asexual reproduction.
    
    Newly generated solutions are typically
    mutated before being added to the
    population.
