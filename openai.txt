Algolia
    [#semantic search]
    [#openai-api]

    Offers highly relevant, fast search to
    everyone with a website, mobile app, or
    voice app.
    
    Combining OpenAI’s API with Algolia’s
    advanced search technology allows
    Algolia’s customers to provide their
    customers with NL semantic search, so they
    can better understand questions and
    connect searchers with results that are
    both relevant and fast.
    
    OpenAI helps Algolia answer more complex
    queries than ever before, trimming down
    the prediction time to around 100ms.
    
    This keeps Algolia from having to do a lot
    of work to cache and serve answers to its
    customers.
    
    With OpenAI, Algolia was able to answer
    complex NL questions accurately 4x as
    often as it was using BERT.

AI Dungeon
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlg]
    [#nlp]

    An AI-powered text adventure where every
    response is determined by an AI LM.
    
    Typically, for these types of games, the
    developer must preprogram a decision tree
    and text options for the user to select
    from.
    
    AI Dungeon is the first of its kind in
    which any story option is possible, and
    the AI adapts the adventure to the users’
    input.
    
    The game sees 20-25,000 daily users.
    
    Initially built on GPT-2, after moving to
    OpenAI’s new technology accessible through
    the API, AI Dungeon has seen a significant
    increase in user engagement and
    subscriptions.
    
    Users have reported positively on the
    speed and quality of conversations, and
    subscriptions for the game have increased
    nearly 25%.
    
    AI Dungeon hopes to expand AI’s use in
    gaming to make for richer experiences
    during gameplay (particularly with non-
    playable characters (NPCs)).

Art of Problem Solving
AoPS
    [#openai-api]
    [#education]
    [#nlp]

    Helping to effectively prepare the next
    generation of STEM professionals through
    engaging online instruction, at a time
    when the traditional nature of in-person
    education is being challenged.
    
    AoPS is breaking enrollment records across
    all their programs due to an onslaught of
    parents searching for at-home learning
    options for the first time.
    
    By delivering faster and more accurate
    student feedback, AoPS can help students
    improve their mathematical problem-solving
    skills and their delivery in explaining
    their answers.
    
    Among the students AoPS have trained are
    nearly all the members of the US
    International Math Olympiad team for the
    past 10 years and a number of the
    researchers / developers at OpenAI.
    
    By leveraging OpenAI’s technology, AoPS is
    empowering its human teachers as they
    evaluate students’ work and provide
    feedback on the accuracy, language and
    mastery of their solutions.
    
    AoPS continues to train OpenAI’s API on
    existing feedback from expert teachers,
    and are using it to quickly generate a
    first draft of feedback on a student’s
    work for the grader to refine and then
    send.
    
    The teacher’s final version is also shared
    back with the API to help improve it even
    further, and the teachers themselves are
    charged with evaluating the tool and
    deciding how widely it gets used.
    
    AoPS is currently testing the technology
    and seeing promising initial results.
    
    In the near term, AoPS believes that with
    OpenAI’s technology, students will be able
    to receive same-day feedback on their work
    while improving quality of feedback.

Natural Language Shell
    [#openai-api]
    [#productivity]
    [#nlp]
    [#semanticsearch]
    [#codegen]

    Here we show how the API can be used to
    translate natural language to unix
    commands, using a handful of
    representative examples.

Spreadsheets
    [#openai-api]
    [#data]
    [#nlp]

    In this example, we show how the API
    generates a table with suggested
    categories to make it easier to extract
    and organize information.

Code Completion
    [#openai-api]
    [#productivity]
    [#nlp]
    [#semanticsearch]
    [#codegen]

    With the API we can generate useful and
    context-aware code suggestions. After
    fine-tuning with code from thousands of
    Open Source GitHub repositories, the API
    completes code based on function names and
    comments.

Content Comprehension
    [openai-api]

    The API can be used to build tools to help
    individuals consume content more
    efficiently.

Koko
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlp]
    [#nlu]

    An online mental health intervention that
    has reached nearly two million people,
    mostly adolescents.
    
    The platform started as a clinical trial
    at MIT and is based on the concept of
    crowdsourced cognitive therapy.
    
    Unlike traditional peer support platforms,
    all interactions on the service are
    supported and augmented by AI.
    
    Koko is using OpenAI’s technology to
    enhance its AI capabilities and improve
    its ability to keep users safe.
    
    Using the API, Koko can automatically
    identify users in acute states of crisis
    and route them to specialized services
    (such as the National Suicide Prevention
    Lifeline).
    
    This builds on Koko’s existing work in
    this area, in collaboration with Harvard
    University, and allows them to scale the
    service more broadly.
    
    This partnership is especially important
    now, given the staggering rise in reported
    mental health symptoms following the onset
    of Covid-19.
    
    With OpenAI, Koko’s text-based classifiers
    improved substantially, without
    preprocessing.
    
    The F1 score of its crisis classifier went
    up from .76 to .86, and the accuracy went
    up to 96%.
    
    In the future, this capability could help
    peer supporters work faster and more
    efficiently, in addition to many other
    therapeutic use cases.

Summarization
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlp]
    [#nlu]

    Through its pattern recognition and
    generative capabilities, the API can
    transform dense text into simplified
    summaries.
    
    Here, we show the API summarizing an NDA
    into content that's accessible at a 2nd-
    grade reading level.

Polyglot
    [openai-api]

    While the API today works best in English,
    it also works quite well in other
    languages.
    
    The API can be used for tasks such as
    translation or chat with users in their
    preferred language.

Translation
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlp]

    In this example we show how the API can be
    used to translate a sentence into another
    language, with only a couple of sentence
    pairs as context.

Fine-tuning
    [NLP]

    To help a language model like GPT-3
    perform more specialized tasks you can
    train it with additional data (like a
    programming language, domain specific
    terminology or special classifications.)

Engines
    The different GPT-3 models the API is able
    to access:
    - Ada,
    - Babbage,
    - Curie, and
    - Davinci.

Ada
    [#OpenAI API]
    [engine]

    Usually the fastest model and can perform
    tasks like parsing text, address
    correction and certain kinds of
    classification tasks that don’t require
    too much nuance. Ada’s performance can
    often be improved by providing more
    context.

API
    [#OpenAI API]

    The term used to describe the model as a
    service platform provided by OpenAI that
    allows developers to interact with and
    build applications with GPT-3.

Best Of
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Generates multiple completions server-side
    and displays on the best.

    How many completions to generate on the
    server side and display the best one.

    Recommended value: 1
    Min value: 1

    Bump it up to 3 or more for question-
    answer, translation or summarization.

Babbage
    [#OpenAI API]
    [engine]

    Can perform straightforward tasks like
    simple classification.
    
    It’s also quite capable when it comes to
    Semantic Search ranking how well documents
    match up with search queries.

Curie
    [#OpenAI API]
    [engine]

    Extremely powerful, yet very fast.
    
    While Davinci is stronger when it comes to
    analyzing complicated text, Curie is quite
    capable for many nuanced tasks like
    sentiment classification and
    summarization.
    
    Curie is also quite good at answering
    questions and performing Q&A and as a
    general service chatbot.

Davinci
    [#OpenAI API]
    [engine]

    Davinci is the most capable engine and can
    perform any task the other models can
    perform and often with less instruction.
    
    For applications requiring a lot of
    understanding of the content, like
    summarization for a specific audience and
    content creative generation, Davinci is
    going to produce the best results.

Echo
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    An API setting that will concatenate the
    prompt and the response sent back from the
    API if set to “True”.

Frequency Penalty
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Floating point value.

    Min value: 0
    Max value: 1

    Determines how much penalize tokens that
    have appeared in the text.
    
    This decreases the model’s likelihood to
    repeat the same text.
    
    If your completion is filled with lots of
    repetition you can increase this setting
    to prevent that from happening.

    How much to penalize new tokens based on
    their existing frequency in the text so
    far.

    Decreases the model's likelihood to repeat
    the same line verbatim.

GPT-3
    GPT-3 stands for Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer 3.
    
    It's a LM with 175 billion parameters that
    makes predictions about what should come
    next in a sequence of text.

Logprobs
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Include the log probabilities on the
    logprobs most likely tokens, as well the
    chosen tokens.
    
    For example, if logprobs is 10, the API
    will return a list of the 10 most likely
    tokens.
    
    the API will always return the logprob of
    the sampled token, so there may be up to
    logprobs+1 elements in the response.

Max tokens
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Determines the maximum
    number of tokens that should be used in
    the generated response.

Model
    A model is a collection of trained
    parameters that can perform a function
    like predicting text, images or other
    data.

Nucleus Sampling
    A method of determining which tokens to
    use that looks at the combined probability
    of groups of tokens.

Playground
    A no-code browser-based interface for the
    API that lets users experiment with
    prompts and settings.

Presence Penalty
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Min value: 0

    Indicates how much to favor new tokens in
    the response text.
    
    This increases the likelihood of the model
    to talk about new topics.
    
    Useful in cases where you want the model
    to be more wide-ranging.

Prompt
    The text sent to the API. The model uses
    the prompt to generate a prediction of
    what text should follow next.

Response length
    [#OpenAI API]
    [playground setting]
    [GPT-3 prompt setting]

    Min value: 64
    Max value: 2048

    Determines the maximum number of tokens
    that should be used in the generated
    response.

    Controls the approximate length of model
    completions, in words.
    
    The maximum number of tokens to
    generate.

    Requests can use up to 2048 tokens shared
    between prompt and completion.

    One token is roughly 4 characters for
    normal English text).

stop sequences
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    The characters or line breaks used to tell
    the model to stop generating response
    text.

    When it sees this symbol, stop generating
    completions so it doesn't just trail off.

    The API will continue generating the
    sequence of text until it generates this.

start sequence
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    [GPT-3 prompt setting]

    Tells the model what to start the
    completion with -- you can make this.

restart sequence
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    [GPT-3 prompt setting]

    Tells the model when to restart the
    sequence.

Semantic Search
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API function]

    Allows you to search for documents related
    to an input query.  The API results a list
    of scores indicating which documents were
    most closely related.

Show Probabilities
    [#OpenAI API]
    [playground setting]

    Highlights the probability of a generated
    token.

Stream
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]

    Whether to stream back partial progress.

    If set, tokens will be sent as data-only
    server-sent events as they become
    available, with the stream terminated by a
    data: DONE message.

tokens
    A sequence of characters that the model
    breaks text into and generates responses
    from.
    
    On average a token is equal to four
    letters or whitespace characters.

prompt

    examples.

    Show the AI a few examples of what you'd
    like it to do.

Temperature
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]
    [GPT-3 prompt setting]
    [GPT hyperparameter]
    [#GPT]

    0.9 recommended value.
    min value: 0
    max value: 1

    Controls token randomness.
    
    A lower setting results in less random
    completions a higher setting is less
    deterministic and repetitive.
    
    Lower settings are generally better for
    classification tasks and higher settings
    for more open-ended responses.

    Float value controlling randomness in
    boltzmann distribution.
    
    Lower temperature results in less random
    completions.
    
    As the temperature approaches zero, the
    model will become deterministic and
    repetitive.
    
    Higher temperature results in more random
    completions.

    How much creative liberty the model has.

    The lower the value, the less creative
    liberty it has.

Top P
    [#OpenAI API]
    [API setting]
    [GPT-3 prompt setting]
    [GPT hyperparameter]
    [#GPT]

    Floating point value.

    Max value: 1
    Recommended value: 1
    Min value: 0

    Cuts of tokens below a certain probability
    threshold.

    We generally recommend keeping it set to
    around 1.

    Similar to temperature, this is an API
    setting that controls the diversity of
    tokens considered using nucleus sampling.
    
    A lower setting results in less random
    completions a higher setting is less
    deterministic and repetitive.
    
    Lower settings are generally better for
    classification tasks and higher settings
    for more open-ended responses.

    Controls diversity via nucleus sampling:
    1.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted
    options are considered.
