Mens rea
    The intent a person has behind committing
    a crime.

    Four different levels:
    - purpose (same as intent),
    - knowledge,
    - recklessness, and
    - negligence.

Actus reus
    The action the person takes to perform the
    criminal act.
    
    This is the physical action behind the
    crime.

implied warranty
    In common law jurisdictions, an implied
    warranty is a contract law term for
    certain assurances that are presumed to be
    made in the sale of products or real
    property, due to the circumstances of the
    sale.

merchantability
    The state of being fit for market; ready
    to be bought or sold.

contract law
    In order to have a valid and binding legal
    contract, three elements are required:
    - an offer,
    - acceptance of that offer, and
    - consideration.

antitrust
    The trust in antitrust refers to a group
    of businesses that team up or form a
    monopoly in order to dictate pricing in a
    particular market.

    Antitrust laws exist to promote
    competition among sellers, limit
    monopolies, and give consumers more
    options

indemnity
    An indemnity is a promise by one party to
    compensate another for the loss suffered
    as a consequence of a specific event,
    called the 'trigger event'.
    
    The trigger event can be anything defined
    by the parties, including:  
    
    - A breach of contract;
    - A party's fault or negligence;
    - A specific action.

    An indemnity operates as a transfer of
    risks between the parties, and changes
    what they would otherwise be liable for or
    entitled to under a normal damage claim.
