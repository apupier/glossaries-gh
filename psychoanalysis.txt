Jungian archetypes
    Defined as universal, primal symbols and
    images that derive from the collective
    unconscious, as proposed by Carl Jung.
    
    They are underlying base forms, or the
    archetypes-as-such, from which emerge
    images and motifs such as the mother, the
    child, the trickster, and the flood among
    others
