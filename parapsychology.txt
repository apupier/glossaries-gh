Extrasensory perception
ESP
sixth sense
    Includes claimed reception of information
    not gained through the recognized physical
    senses, but sensed with the mind.

telepathy
    The supposed communication of thoughts or
    ideas by means other than the known
    senses.

    The purported vicarious transmission of
    information from one person to another
    without using any known human sensory
    channels or physical interaction.

precognition
prescience
future vision
future sight
promnesia
    A claimed psychic ability to see events in
    the future.
    
    As with other paranormal phenomena, there
    is no accepted scientific evidence that
    precognition is a real effect and it is
    widely considered to be pseudoscience.

    Promnesia is similar to precognition,
    which means knowing something and being
    able to describe it before you encounter
    it, but has a more visual meaning. It's
    the déjà vu of parapsychology.

clairvoyance
    The supposed faculty of perceiving things
    or events in the future or beyond normal
    sensory contact.

psychokinesis
telekinesis
psychometry
    An alleged psychic ability allowing a
    person to influence a physical system
    without physical interaction.
    
    Psychokinesis experiments have
    historically been criticized for lack of
    proper controls and repeatability.
