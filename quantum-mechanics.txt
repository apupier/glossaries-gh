Schr√∂dinger equation
    A linear partial differential equation
    that describes the wave function or state
    function of a quantum-mechanical system.
    It is a key result in quantum mechanics,
    and its discovery was a significant
    landmark in the development of the
    subject.

    Describes how the state of a system
    evolves.
