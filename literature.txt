tawdry
    Showy but cheap and of poor quality.

innuendo
    A form of wordplay.

    Saying one thing and meaning another.
    
    Innuendo only works when both parties
    understand the intended meaning.

    Example:
    - Woman 1: Do you know Arthur?
    - Woman 2: Oh yes, I know him very well.

    The intended meaning, of course, is that
    Woman 2 and ‘Arthur’ are intimately
    familiar.

double Entendre
    A form of wordplay.
    
    It relies on an ambiguity in the phrasing
    or use of words in a statement.
    
    It is when a statement can be ‘read two
    ways’ (or three ways for a triple
    entendre).
    
    Typically the joke works because one
    reading is perfectly innocuous, whilst the
    second is rude, tawdry or sexual.

    Double Entendres have been a staple of
    comedy from music hall to vaudeville and a
    lot of 20th century English comedy,
    notably the Carry On films.

    Example:
    - New school head checks scaled back

    The first (intended) meaning is that
    checks for new school headteachers are to
    be reduced.

    The second (tawdry) is that the new school
    headteacher checks his scaled back,
    indicating he may be a reptile.

pun
    A form of wordplay.
    
    A pun exploits a word with two meanings,
    or two similar-sounding words for comedic
    effect.
    
    Puns may well be the oldest form of joke.

    Examples:
    “I have a dentist’s appointment at
    tooth-hurty (two-thirty)”.

    A fish and chip shop called ‘The
    Codfather’.

    Setup: “Why did the apple turn over?”
    Punchline: “Because it saw the swiss roll!
    This one’s a double pun because both apple
    turnover and swiss roll are types of
    dessert.

euphemism
    A form of wordplay.

    Substituting one word or expression for
    another whilst still preserving the
    meaning.
    
    This is done in order to render ‘polite’ a
    subject that is potentially offensive,
    frightening or upsetting.

    Examples:
    - ‘Passed away’ for died
    - ‘Making love’ for having sex
    - ‘Gardening leave’ for suspension from
      work.
