    and get the bonus).

    you, you are looking for what's called a
    partscore contract.

    Once you reach 25 points between you then
    you are looking for a game level contract.

    If you make this contract you get a bonus.

make game
    Successfully completing a game contract.

    The number of trick you need to make game
    depends on the contract you're in.

slam
game level contract
    [contract]

    You need around 33+ points between you and
    your partner to bidding a contract up at
    the slam level.

honor cards
    A, K, Q, J

    They are assigned a point count.

    A = 4 HCP
    K = 3 HCP
    Q = 2 HCP
    J = 1 HCP

    There are 40 total HCP available to all
    players.

fit
    When you and your partner have between you
    8 or more cards in one of the suits.

    If there is a fit then this will be the
    trump suit.

    If there is no fit then you should choose
    No Trumps.

    If there is a fit in a minor then you can
    choose whether to play in the minor or No
    Trumps.

    It's not the quality of the cards that
    counts but the quantity.

trick
    Each player keeps their own cards in front
    of them.

    If you win the trick you place the cards
    vertically in front of you.

    If you lose the trick you place them
    horizontally.
