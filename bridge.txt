    The auction concludes when there have been
    3 passes in a row.

    When you make a bid you are always
    suggesting to your partner that you can
    make more than 1 half of the available 13
    tricks (7 tricks at least).

    If you open the bidding 1H you'll be
    saying I can make 6 tricks + 1.

    Not to be confused with "opening lead".

equal lengths rule of thumb
    [#1-level suit opening]

    Sometimes you have 2 suits of equal
    length.

    Examples:
    - bottoms-up
    - tops-down

    These rules of thumb should still be
    followed.

bottoms-up
    [#1-level suit opening]

    [rule of thumb]
    [equal lengths rule of thumb]

    If those suits are 4 cards in length then
    you should bid your lowest ranked suit
    first.

    If you have 4 spades and 4 diamonds, you
    bid 1 diamond.

tops-down
    [#1-level suit opening]

    [rule of thumb]
    [equal lengths rule of thumb]

    If those suits are 5 cards in length then
    you should bid your highest ranked suit
    first.

    If you have 5 spades and 5 diamonds, you
    bid 1 spade.

Opening 1-suit
Opening the bidding 1-suit
1-level suit opening
    Opening the bidding with 1 of a suit.

    Rules:
    - You must have enough HCP.
    - You need 12-19 HCP.

    Count the high card points.
    If you don't have 12, you can't bid for 1.

    Is this a strict rule or rule of thumb?

    By opening the bidding you are telling
    your partner you have between 12 and 19
    HCP.

    When you bid a suit you are also telling
    your partner you have at least 4 of that
    suit.

    An exception to the above:
    - When you bid 1NT, you are telling your
      partner you have between 12 and (only)
      14 HCP and that your hand is balanced.

    Rules of thumb:
    - Bid your longest suit first
    - bottoms-up
    - tops-down

    See "bottoms-up".
    See "tops-down".

    - partscore
    - game
    - slam

contract
    Has levels.

major contract
    Does this include a NT contract or do you
    call that a no trumps contract?

minor contract
    Less popular because you need to get more
    tricks to 'make game' (reach game level
    and get the bonus).

partscore
partscore contract
partscore level contract
    [contract]

    When you have less than 25 points between
    you, you are looking for what's called a
    partscore contract.

game level
    This is a significant level of bidding in
    bridge.

    3NT
    4S
    4H
    5D
    5C

    At the game level you get bonus points for
    making your contract.

game
game contract
game level contract
    [contract]

    Once you reach 25 points between you then
    you are looking for a game level contract.

    If you make this contract you get a bonus.

make game
    Successfully completing a game contract.

    The number of trick you need to make game
    depends on the contract you're in.

slam
slam contract
slam level contract
    [contract]

    You need around 33+ points between you and
    your partner to bidding a contract up at
    the slam level.

honor cards
    A, K, Q, J

    They are assigned a point count.

    A = 4 HCP
    K = 3 HCP
    Q = 2 HCP
    J = 1 HCP

    There are 40 total HCP available to all
    players.

fit
    When you and your partner have between you
    8 or more cards in one of the suits.

    If there is a fit then this will be the
    trump suit.

    If there is no fit then you should choose
    No Trumps.

    If there is a fit in a minor then you can
    choose whether to play in the minor or No
    Trumps.

    It's not the quality of the cards that
    counts but the quantity.

trick
    Each player keeps their own cards in front
    of them.

    If you win the trick you place the cards
    vertically in front of you.

    If you lose the trick you place them
    horizontally.
