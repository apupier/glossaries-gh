var

    Syntax sugar for getter/setter methods
    that look like fields.
    
    Instead of having to use the methods
    item.getQuantity() and item.setQuantity(),
    we can access the property item.quantity
    and set it using item.quantity = 1,
    exactly like a field.
    
    The compiler transforms property access
    and assignment to use the appropriate
    getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
    
    The most noteworthy consequence of this
    is, in my opinion, allowing validation on
    assigment.
    
    For example, item.quantity may be defined
    as follows (in Kotlin):
