Ship of Theseus
    [metaphysics of identity]
    
    The ship of Theseus is a thought
    experiment that raises the question of
    whether an object that has had all of its
    components replaced remains fundamentally
    the same object.

loom
    A symbol of cosmic creation and the
    structure upon which individual destiny is
    woven.
    
    This symbolism is encapsulated in the
    classical myth of Arachne who was changed
    into a spider by the goddess Athena, who
    was jealous of her skill at the godlike
    craft of weaving.
    
    In Maya civilization the goddess Ixchel
    taught the first woman how to weave at the
    beginning of time.
