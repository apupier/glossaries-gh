psq
    sudo pip3.5 install psq

    Cloud Pub/Sub Task Queue for Python.

    Pub/sub guarantees your tasks will be
    delivered to the workers, but psq doesn't
    presently guarantee that a task completes
    execution or exactly-once semantics,
    though it does allow you to provide your
    own mechanisms for this.
    
    This is similar to Celery's default
    configuration.
