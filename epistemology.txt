reflexivity
    [epistemology]
    [sociology of knowledge]

    Refers to circular relationships between
    cause and effect, especially as embedded
    in human belief structures.

    Generally refers to the examination of
    one's own beliefs, judgments and practices
    during the research process and how these
    may have influenced the research.

    If positionality refers to what we know
    and believe then reflexivity is about what
    we do with this knowledge.

epistemology

    regard to its methods, validity, and
    scope, and the distinction between
    justified belief and opinion.
