Makemake
    [dwarf planet]

    Resides in the outer solar system.
    
    It was the fourth body identified as a
    dwarf planet, and was one of the bodies
    that caused Pluto to lose its status as a
    planet.
    
    Makemake is large enough and bright enough
    to be studied by a high-end amateur
    telescope.

    [optics]

    radiation that is reflected by a surface,
    typically that of a planet or moon.
