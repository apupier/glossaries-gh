Nearest neighbor search
NNS
    [form of proximity search]
    
    The optimization problem of finding the
    point in a given set that is closest (or
    most similar) to a given point.
    
    Closeness is typically expressed in terms
    of a dissimilarity function: the less
    similar the objects, the larger the
    function values.
