syllogism
    A syllogism is a kind of logical argument
    that applies deductive reasoning to arrive
    at a conclusion based on two or more
    propositions that are asserted or assumed
    to be true.

    In a form, defined by Aristotle, from the
    combination of a general statement and a
    specific statement, a conclusion is
    deduced.

Homotopy type theory
HoTT
    Various lines of development of
    intuitionistic type theory, based on the
    interpretation of types as objects to
    which the intuition of (abstract) homotopy
    theory applies.

SMT instance
    A generalization of a Boolean SAT instance
    in which various sets of variables are
    replaced by predicates from a variety of
    underlying theories.
    
    SMT formulas provide a much richer
    modeling language than is possible with
    Boolean SAT formulas.

SMT problem
    An extended version of SAT problem.
    
    Given a formula, checking if there is a
    set of values for variables that satisfies
    the formula.
    
    The difference is, that SAT only deals
    with boolean expressions, whereas SMT can
    handle various types such as integer, bit
    vector and real number.
    
    Depending on which theory to use, you can
    express constraints in different formats.
    
    This time, we will use linear integer
    arithmetic, where equations in the SMT
    problems are linear equations over integer
    variables.
    
    There are many SMT Solvers, but I chose Z3
    because it is well documented and is
    ported to Python language.
    
    It’s really easy to use.

Conjunctive Normal Form
CNF
cnf
    Like many SAT solvers, MiniSAT requires
    that its input be in CNF.

    Built from these building blocks:
    - term
      A term is either a boolean variable
      (e.g., x4) or a negated boolean variable
      (NOT x4, written here as -x4).

    - clause
      A clause is a set of one or more terms,
      connected with OR (written here as |);
      boolean variables may not repeat inside
      a clause.

    - expression
      An expression is a set of one or more
      clauses, each connected by AND (written
      here as &).

modus ponens
method of affirming
    [#logic]
    [rule of logic]

    The rule of logic which states that if a
    conditional statement (‘if p then q ’) is
    accepted, and the antecedent ( p ) holds,
    then the consequent ( q ) may be inferred.

    If a conditional statement (‘if p then q
    ’) is accepted, and the antecedent ( p )
    holds, then the consequent ( q ) may be
    inferred.

subject
    https://www.jstor.org/stable/1398382?origin=crossref

predicate
    Takes an argument as input and outputs
    true or false.

    Example, -type in the find command.
        "-type f" is not a predicate.

        The predicate is 'is the type', not
        'the type is f'.

        Predicates can take several variables.

        "Socrates is the teacher of Plato",
        the predicate "is the teacher of"
        takes two variables.

        Therefore the predicate "-type"
        actually takes 2 variables, the
        current node being checked and the
        type of the node.

    The part of a sentence or clause
    containing a verb and stating something
    about the subject (e.g. went home in John
    went home ).

    Something which is affirmed or denied
    concerning an argument of a proposition.
