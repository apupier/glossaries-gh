mind-body problem
     A debate concerning the relationship
     between thought and consciousness in the
     human mind, and the brain as part of the
     physical body.
     
     It is distinct from the question of how
     mind and body function chemically and
     physiologically, as that question
     presupposes an interactionist account of
     mindâ€“body relations.
     
     This question arises when mind and body
     are considered as distinct, based on the
     premise that the mind and the body are
     fundamentally different in nature.

Interactionist
interactionism
    [sociology]

    A theoretical perspective that derives
    social processes (such as conflict,
    cooperation, identity formation) from
    human interaction.
    
    It is the study of how individuals shape
    society and are shaped by society through
    meaning that arises in interactions.
    
    Interactionist theory has grown in the
    latter half of the twentieth century and
    has become one of the dominant
    sociological perspectives in the world
    today.

    George Herbert Mead, as an advocate of
    pragmatism and the subjectivity of social
    reality, is considered a leader in the
    development of interactionism.
    
    Herbert Blumer expanded on Mead's work and
    coined the term "symbolic interactionism".
