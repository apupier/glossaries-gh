stochastic memoization
    [#probabilistic programming]

    Remembering probabilistic events that have
    already occurred.

    Example:
        $MYGIT/mullikine/problog-examples/stochastic-memoisation.problog

    Example2:
        $MYGIT/mullikine/problog-examples/stochastic-memoisation-zeros.problog

        The reason that most sequences have
        probability zero, is that if it
        encounters the same die a second time,
        it will not roll it again, but reuse
        the (memoized) result of the previous
        roll. 

Meta-predicates
    Apply a predicate on all members of a list
    (or higher-order functions) such as map,
    partition, fold, and scan.
