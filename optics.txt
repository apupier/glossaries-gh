albedo
    The proportion of the incident light or
    radiation that is reflected by a surface,
    typically that of a planet or moon.

wavefront
    A wave front is defined as a surface over
    which the phase of the wave is constant.
    
    In a particular wave front, at a given
    moment of time, all particles of the
    medium are undergoing the same motion.
    
    Two types of wave fronts are particularly
    important.
    
    They are plane wave fronts and spherical
    wave fronts.

phase
out of phase
    A definition of the position of a point in
    time (instant) on a waveform cycle.

    Phase can also be an expression of
    relative displacement between or among
    waves having the same frequency .

    Phase is the same frequency, same cycle,
    same wavelength, but are 2 or more wave
    forms not exactly aligned together.
    
    "Phase is not a property of just one RF
    signal but instead involves the
    relationship between two or more signals
    that share the same frequency.
    
    Below is an example of 2 wave forms 90
    degree out of phase.
