neural ranking models
    Their power lies in the ability to learn
    from the raw text inputs for the ranking
    problem to avoid many limitations of hand-
    crafted features.
    
    NNs have sufficient capacity to model
    complicated tasks, which is needed to
    handle the complexity of relevance
    estimation in ranking.

    Neural ranking models for IR use shallow
    or deep NNs to rank search results in
    response to a query.
    
    Traditional learning to rank models employ
    supervised ML techniques—including
    NNs—over hand-crafted IR features.
    
    By contrast, more recently proposed neural
    models learn representations of language
    from raw text that can bridge the gap
    between query and document vocabulary.
    
    Unlike classical learning to rank models
    and non-neural approaches to IR, these new
    ML techniques are data-hungry, requiring
    large scale training data before they can
    be deployed.
    
    This tutorial introduces basic concepts
    and intuitions behind neural IR models,
    and places them in the context of
    classical non-neural approaches to IR.
    
    We begin by introducing fundamental
    concepts of retrieval and different neural
    and non-neural approaches to unsupervised
    learning of vector representations of
    text.
    
    We then review IR methods that employ
    these pre-trained neural vector
    representations without learning the IR
    task end-to-end.
    
    We introduce the LTR framework next,
    discussing standard loss functions for
    ranking.
    
    We follow that with an overview of deep
    NNs (DNNs), including standard
    architectures and implementations.
    
    Finally, we review supervised neural
    learning to rank models, including recent
    DNN architectures trained end-to-end for
    ranking tasks.
    
    We conclude with a discussion on potential
    future directions for neural IR.
