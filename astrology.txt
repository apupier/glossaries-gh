Ecliptic
    The ecliptic is the plane of Earth's orbit
    around the Sun.

    From the perspective of an observer on
    Earth, the Sun's movement around the
    celestial sphere over the course of a year
    traces out a path along the ecliptic
    against the background of stars.

Zodiac
    The zodiac is an area of the sky that
    extends approximately 8Â° north or south of
    the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun
    across the celestial sphere over the
    course of the year.

    The paths of the Moon and visible planets
    are also within the belt of the zodiac.

Gemini
    [Astrological sign]

    Gemini is the third astrological sign in
    the zodiac, originating from the

    tropical zodiac, the sun transits this
    sign between about May 21 to June 21.
    Under the sidereal zodiac, the sun
