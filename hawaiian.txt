    different manifestations of rainbows that
    are possible.
    
    There are words for Earth-clinging
    rainbows (uakoko), standing rainbow shafts
    (khili), barely visible rainbows
    (punakea), and moonbows (nuenue kau pM),

    cultures around the world, says Businger
    in a press release.
