iron egg
    https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/909

    The dish consists of small eggs that have
    been repeatedly stewed in a mix of spices
    and air-dried.
    
    The resulting eggs are dark brown on the
    outside, chewy in texture, and very
    flavourful compared to standard boiled
    eggs.
    
    It has been said to taste "sweet, spicy
    and slightly salty with a concentrated egg
    flavourâ€”a great snack with drinks".
