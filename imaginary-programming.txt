imaginary programming
    Programming with functions based on
    language models.

ordinary programming
    Programming with functions that do not
    have an imaginary dimension (they do not
    take a language model as a parameter and
    the result of ordinary code is not
    polluted by a language model).

holographic programming
    [type of imaginary programming]

    This is like imaginary programming but
    where the language models are trained on
    software.
