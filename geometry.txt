rational polygon
    A polygon is called rational if the angle
    between each pair of sides is a rational
    multiple of Ï€.

inversive geometry
    The study of those properties of figures
    that are preserved by a generalization of
    a type of transformation of the Euclidean
    plane, called inversion.
    
    These transformations preserve angles and
    map generalized circles into generalized
    circles, where a generalized circle means
    either a circle or a line (loosely
    speaking, a circle with infinite radius).
    
    Many difficult problems in geometry become
    much more tractable when an inversion is
    applied.
    
    The concept of inversion can be
    generalized to higher-dimensional spaces.

Heesch number
    A measure of the maximum number of times
    you can surround the shape with layers of
    copies of itself.
