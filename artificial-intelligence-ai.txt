ES
evolution strategy
    An optimization technique based on ideas
    of evolution.
    
    It belongs to the general class of
    evolutionary computation or artificial
    evolution methodologies.

Statistical Relational Learning
    [subdiscipline of AI and ML]

    Concerned with domain models exhibiting:
    - uncertainty
      (which can be dealt with using
      statistical methods)
    - complex, relational structure.

Connectionist
    Tries to model knowledge by imitating
    representations of the brain in the form
    of neural networks and have been the
    driving force behind movements such as
    deep learning.

Symbolists
    Relies on logic to model knowledge based
    on well-understood rules.

ANN
Artificial Neural Networks
    Powerful function approximators capable of
    modeling solutions to a wide variety of
    problems, both supervised and
    unsupervised.
