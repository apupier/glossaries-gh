tripartite alignment
    A type of morphosyntactic alignment in
    which the main argument ('subject') of an
    intransitive verb, the agent argument
    ('subject') of a transitive verb, and the
    patient argument ('direct object') of a
    transitive verb are each treated
    distinctly in the grammatical system of a
    language.
    
    This is in contrast with nominative-
    accusative and ergative-absolutive
    alignment languages, in which the argument
    of an intransitive verb patterns with
    either the agent argument of the
    transitive (in accusative languages) or
    with the patient argument of the
    transitive (in ergative languages).
    
    Thus, whereas in English, "she" in "she
    runs" patterns with "she" in "she finds
    it", and an ergative language would
    pattern "she" in "she runs" with "her" in
    "he likes her", a tripartite language
    would treat the "she" in "she runs" as
    morphologically and/or syntactically
    distinct from either argument in "he likes
    her".

morphological typology
    A way of classifying the languages of the
    world (see linguistic typology) that
    groups languages according to their common
    morphological structures.
    
    The field organizes languages on the basis
    of how those languages form words by
    combining morphemes.
    
    Analytic languages contain very little
    inflection, instead relying on features
    like word order and auxiliary words to
    convey meaning.
    
    Synthetic languages, ones that are not
    analytic, are divided into two categories:
    agglutinative and fusional languages

linguistic typology
language typology
    [field of linguistics]
    
    Studies and classifies languages according
    to their structural and functional
    features.
    
    Its aim is to describe and explain the
    common properties and the structural
    diversity of the world's languages.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology

agglutination
    Words may contain different morphemes to
    determine their meanings, but all of these
    morphemes (including stems and affixes)
    remain, in every aspect, unchanged after
    their unions.

agglutinative language
    [synthetic language]
    
    Its morphology primarily uses
    agglutination.

    This results in generally more easily
    deducible word meanings if compared to
    fusional languages, which allow
    modifications in either or both the
    phonetics or spelling of one or more
    morphemes within a word, usually
    shortening the word or providing easier
    pronunciation.
    
    Agglutinative languages have generally one
    grammatical category per affix while
    fusional languages have multiple.
    
    The term was introduced by Wilhelm von
    Humboldt to classify languages from a
    morphological point of view.
    
    It is derived from the Latin verb
    agglutinare, which means "to glue
    together".

fusional languages
    Non-agglutinative synthetic languages are
    fusional languages; morphologically, they
    combine affixes by "squeezing" them
    together, drastically changing them in the
    process, and joining several meanings in a
    single affix (for example, in the Spanish
    word comí "I ate", the suffix -í carries
    the meanings of first person, singular
    number, past tense, perfective aspect,
    indicative mood, active voice.)
    
    The term agglutinative is sometimes
    incorrectly used as a synonym for
    synthetic.
    
    Used in this way, the term embraces both
    fusional languages and inflected
    languages.[clarification needed]
    
    The agglutinative and fusional languages
    are two ends of a continuum, with various
    languages falling more toward one or the
    other end.
    
    For example, Japanese is generally
    agglutinative, but displays fusion in
    otōto (弟 younger brother), from oto+hito
    (originally woto+pito), and in its non-
    affixing verb conjugations.
    
    A synthetic language may use morphological
    agglutination combined with partial usage
    of fusional features, for example in its
    case system (e.g., German, Dutch, and
    Persian).
    
    Agglutinative languages tend to have a
    high rate of affixes or morphemes per
    word, and to be very regular, in
    particular with very few irregular verbs.
    
    For example, Japanese has very few
    irregular verbs –
    
    only two are significantly irregular, and
    there are only about a dozen others with
    only minor irregularity; Ganda has only
    one (or two, depending on how "irregular"
    is defined); while in the Quechua
    languages, all the ordinary verbs are
    regular.
    
    In Turkish, there is only one irregular
    noun (su, meaning water), no irregular
    verbs other than the copular verbs, and
    two existential particles.
    
    Korean has only ten irregular forms of
    conjugation except for the passive and
    causative conjugations.
    
    Georgian is an exception; it is highly
    agglutinative (with up to eight morphemes
    per word), but it has a significant number
    of irregular verbs with varying degrees of
    irregularity.

anaphora
anaphoric
    An expression, or the use of an
    expression, whose interpretation depends
    upon another expression in context.

    Example,
        Anaphoric if

subject-verb-object
SVO

Cohesion
    The grammatical and lexical linking within
    a text or sentence that holds a text
    together and gives it meaning.
    
    It is related to the broader concept of
    coherence.

lexicon
word-hoard
wordbook
word-stock
    The vocabulary of a person, language, or
    branch of knowledge.
    
    In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's
    inventory of lexemes.

rewrite rule
rewriting rule
    [#linguistics]
    [phrase-structure rule]
    
    Phrase-structure rule in a generative
    grammar, shown as an instruction to
    replace or rewrite a single symbol,
    representing a syntactic structure, on the
    left with one or more symbols,
    representing the constituents of the
    structure, on the right, as in S → NP +
    VP, where S (sentence) is to be replaced
    with its constituents NP (noun phrase) and
    VP (verb phrase).

Distributional hypothesis
    [#linguistics]

    Linguistic items with similar
    distributions have similar meanings.

distributed semantics
    [#linguistics]
    [research area]
    
    Develops and studies theories and methods
    for quantifying and categorizing semantic
    similarities between linguistic items
    based on their distributional properties
    in large samples of language data.
    
    The basic idea of distributional semantics
    can be summed up in the so-called
    Distributional hypothesis.

morphology
    The study of words, how they are formed,
    and their relationship to other words in
    the same language.
    
    It analyzes the structure of words and
    parts of words, such as stems, root words,
    prefixes, and suffixes.
    
    Morphology also looks at parts of speech,
    intonation and stress, and the ways
    context can change a word's pronunciation
    and meaning.
    
    Morphology differs from morphological
    typology, which is the classification of
    languages based on their use of words, and
    lexicology, which is the study of words
    and how they make up a language's
    vocabulary.

realization
    [#linguistics]
    
    The process by which some kind of surface
    representation is derived from its
    underlying representation; that is, the
    way in which some abstract object of
    linguistic analysis comes to be produced
    in actual language.
    
    Phonemes are often said to be realized by
    speech sounds.

linguistic categories
    Examples:
    - noun
    - verb
    - adjective

    https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8825-4_1

fuzzy linguistic categories
    [#corpus linguistics]

universal category
    Many linguists see NOUN and VERB as
    universal categories.

    But how universal are they really?
    https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8825-4_1

inter-annotator aggreement
    A measure of how well two (or more)
    annotators can make the same annotation
    decision for a certain category.

    https://corpuslinguisticmethods.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/what-is-inter-annotator-agreement/

    Even basic categories such as parts of
    speech are not entirely clearly defined.
    
    As a corpus linguist, you make some
    decision for the annotation, but you
    actually want to provide the user of your
    dataset with some kind of a metric about
    how certain you are about the annotation
    of that category.
    
    Well, that is where inter-annotator
    agreement comes into play.

literary consonance
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_consonance
    
    A stylistic literary device identified by
    the repetition of identical or similar
    consonants in neighbouring words whose
    vowel sounds are different (e.g. coming
    home, hot foot).
    
    Consonance may be regarded as the
    counterpart to the vowel-sound repetition
    known as assonance.
    
    Alliteration is a special case of
    consonance where the repeated consonant
    sound is at the stressed syllable, as in
    "few flocked to the fight" or "around the
    rugged rock the ragged rascal ran".
    
    Alliteration is usually distinguished from
    other types of consonance in poetic
    analysis, and has different uses and
    effects.
    
    Another special case of consonance is
    sibilance, the use of several sibilant
    sounds such as /s/ and /sh/.
    
    An example is the verse from Edgar Allan
    Poe's "The Raven": "And the silken sad
    uncertain rustling of each purple
    curtain."
    
    (This example also contains assonance
    around the "ur" sound.)
    
    Another example of consonance is the word
    "sibilance" itself.

semantics vs pragmatics
    Semantics is the study of meaning, or more
    precisely, the study of the relation
    between linguistic expressions and their
    meanings.

    Pragmatics is the study of context, or
    more precisely, a study of the way context
    can influence our understanding of
    linguistic utterances.

rhetorical device
    [linguistic tool]

    Employs a particular type of sentence
    structure, sound, or pattern of meaning in
    order to evoke a particular reaction from
    an audience.
    
    Each rhetorical device is a distinct tool
    that can be used to construct an argument
    or make an existing argument more
    compelling.

morphosyntactic
    Involving both morphology and syntax.

morphosyntactic alignment
    Morphosyntactic alignment is the
    grammatical relationship between
    arguments—specifically, between the two
    arguments of transitive verbs like the dog
    chased the cat, and the single argument of
    intransitive verbs like the cat ran away.

polysemy
    The ability of words to have multiple
    meanings.

function words
functioning words
functors
    Words that have little lexical meaning or
    have ambiguous meaning and express
    grammatical relationships among other
    words within a sentence, or specify the
    attitude or mood of the speaker.
    
    They signal the structural relationships
    that words have to one another and are the
    glue that holds sentences together.
    
    Thus they form important elements in the
    structures of sentences.

bearing
content bearing
    Said to be provided by a document's
    content words.

content words
open class words
lexical words
autosemantic words
    Words that are considered to carry a
    meaning related to the text are described
    as the "content bearing".

    Words that are not function words.

    Include:
    - nouns,
    - verbs,
    - adjectives, and
    - most adverbs, although some adverbs are
      function words (e.g., then and why).

    Dictionaries define the specific meanings
    of content words, but can only describe
    the general usages of function words.
    
    By contrast, grammars describe the use of
    function words in detail, but treat
    lexical words in general terms only.

imperative mood
    A form of a verb that expresses an order
    or a request or an advice or encouragement
    or instruction or suggestion to do a
    thing.
    
    Examples of The Imperative Mood:
    - Work sincerely.
    - Try to keep quiet.
    - Please have your food on time.

indicative form
indicative mood
    A verb form that makes a statement or asks
    a question. For example: 

    - Jack sings every Friday.
      (This is a verb in the indicative mood.
      It's a statement.) 
    - Is Jack the lead vocalist?
      (This is a verb in the indicative mood.
      It's a question.) 
    
    Compare the examples above with this: 
    
    - Sing us a song, Jack.
      (This verb is not in the indicative
      mood. It is in the imperative mood. It's
      an order. It's not a statement or a
      question.)

inflected
inflection
    [linguistic morphology]

    A process of word formation, in which a
    word is modified to express different
    grammatical categories such as tense,
    case, voice, aspect, person, number,
    gender, mood, animacy, and definiteness. 

agglutinative language
    A type of synthetic language with
    morphology that primarily uses
    agglutination.
    
    Words may contain different morphemes to
    determine their meanings, but all of these
    morphemes remain, in every aspect,
    unchanged after their unions.

agglutination
    The clumping of particles.
    
    The word agglutination comes from the
    Latin agglutinare (glueing to).
    
    Agglutination is the process that occurs
    if an antigen is mixed with its
    corresponding antibody called
    isoagglutinin.
    
    This term is commonly used in blood
    grouping.

agglutinative
agglutinative morphology
    (of a language) forming words
    predominantly by agglutination, rather
    than by inflection or by using isolated
    elements.
    
    Examples include Hungarian, Turkish,
    Korean, and Swahili.
