Prolog
    Extremely well suited for solving
    combinatorial tasks like Sudoku.

predicate
    [#prolog]

assignment
    [#prolog]
    [operator]

    5 is X+2.

    Unlike =, the right hand side of IS must
    always be bound, thus guaranteeing no
    attempt to solve an equation.

unification
    [#prolog]
    [operator]

    Essentially a combination of assignment
    and equality.

    vimlinks +/"?- 2 = 3." "https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/prolog/"

    If both sides are bound (ie, defined),
    check equality.
    2 = 3

    IMPORTANT (the essence of unification):
    If one side is free (ie, undefined),
    assign to match the other side.
    X = 3

    If both sides are free, the assignment is
    remembered. With some luck, one of the two
    sides will eventually be bound, but this
    isn't necessary.
    X = Y are both free, so Prolog remembers
    it. Therefore assigning X will also assign
    Y. IS is another assigment operator in prolog.
    X = Y, X = 2, Z is Y + 3.

member
    [predicate]

    Fundamental Prolog tool for manipulating
    lists.
