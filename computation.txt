model of computation
    [#computability theory]
    [#computational complexity theory]

    A model which describes how an output of a
    mathematical function is computed given an
    input.
    
    A model describes how units of
    computations, memories, and communications
    are organized.

    Classified in three categories:
    - sequential models,
    - functional models, and
    - concurrent models.

    Sequential models include:
    - Finite state machines
    - Pushdown automata
    - Random access machines
    - Turing machines

    Functional models include:
    - Lambda calculus
    - General recursive functions
    - Combinatory logic
    - Abstract rewriting systems

    Concurrent models include:
    - Cellular automaton
    - Kahn process networks
    - Petri nets
    - Synchronous Data Flow
    - Interaction nets
    - Actor model
