table
    [#RDBMS]

    In datomic, we do away with the concept of
    a table.

    You could say datomic ONLY specifies
    'columns'.

    Additionally, these columns have no
    relationship to (or grouping with) any
    other column.

    Contrast this with an RDBMS which groups
    columns with the concept of a table.
