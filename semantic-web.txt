vocabulary

ontology
ontologies
    Define the concepts and relationships
    (also referred to as “terms”) used to
    describe and represent an area of concern.
    
    Used to classify the terms that can be
    used in a particular application,
    characterize possible relationships, and
    define possible constraints on using those
    terms.
    
    The basic building blocks
    for inference techniques on the Semantic
    Web.

    In practice, can be very complex (with
    several thousands of terms) or very simple
    (describing one or two concepts only).
    
    Use "ontology" for more complex, and
    possibly quite formal collection of terms.

    Use "vocabulary" when such strict
    formalism is not necessarily used or only
    in a very loose sense.
