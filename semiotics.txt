physiosemiosis
    [#Basics of Semiotics]

    Laid down the argument that the action of
    signs extends even further than life, and
    that semiosis as an influence of the
    future played a role in the shaping of the
    physical universe prior to the advent of
    life, a role for which Deely coined the
    term physiosemiosis.

    Poles:
    - Pole of the stipulable sign.
    - Pole of the semiotic other
    - Pole of the interpretant
    - Pole of the semiotic self
    - Pole of the object experienced

    Circumferal axes:
    - Identical axis
    - Perlocutionary axis
    - Supposed conventional axis
    - Conventional axis
    - Experiential axis

    Inner axes:
    - Symptomatic axis
    - Taxonomic axis
    - Contractual axis
    - Informational axis
    - Supposed experiential axis

semiotics
    The study of signs and symbols and their
    use or interpretation.

zoosemiotics
    The semiotic study of the use of signs
    among animals, more precisely the study of
    semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of
    how something comes to function as a sign
    to some animal.
    
    It is the study of animal forms of
    knowing.

discourse
    Commonly speaking, the interaction between
    sense and understanding.

discursive
    [#language]
    [#philosophy]

    Digressing from subject to subject.

    "students often write dull, second-hand,
    discursive prose"

    Relating to discourse or modes of
    discourse.

    "the attempt to transform utterances from
    one discursive context to another"

    The question arises, could an intellectual
    semiosis be possible that did not arise
    out of and have constantly at its disposal
    a perceptual base of cognitive materials
    with which to work?
    
    Since discourse, commonly speaking, is
    precisely this interaction between sense
    and understanding, we are asking whether
    there even can be an intellectual semiosis
    which is not discursive.
    
    Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
    semiosis extend even beyond the world of
    matter and motion, to achieve its effect
    and proper work also in a realm of pure
    spirits bodiless from the start?

umwelt
    [#semiotics]

    The "biological foundations that lie at
    the very epicenter of the study of both
    communication and signification in the
    human [and non-human] animal".

    The term is usually translated as "self-
    centered world".

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs and sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
    communication.

    It is not to be confused with the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics.

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs and symbols as a significant part
    of communications.

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems.
