    [#semiotics]

    The "biological foundations that lie at
    the very epicenter of the study of both
    communication and signification in the
    human [and non-human] animal".

    The term is usually translated as "self-
    centered world".

Semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs and sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
    communication.

    It is not to be confused with the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics.

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs and symbols as a significant part
    of communications.

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems.
