Gemini
    [Protocol]

    The Gemini protocol is an application
    layer protocol for distributed hypertext
    information systems that provides access
    to simple, primarily textual documents in
    Gemini space.

    This is done with contemporary
    technologies such as TLS, thereby
    improving privacy and user agency relative
    to the Web.
