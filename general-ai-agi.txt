    Aim:
        To be the white-box version of DNNs.
    
    Provides a simple, universal yet powerful
    structure, similar to DNN, to represent
    any knowledge of the world, which is
    transparent to humans.
    
    Conjecture:
        Any type of real world objects sharing
        enough common features are mapped into
        human brains as a symbol.
    
        Those symbols are connected by links,
        representing the composition,
        correlation, causality, or other
        relationships between them, forming a
        deep, hierarchical symbolic network
        structure.
    
    Powered by such a structure, the DSN model
    is expected to learn like humans, because
    of its unique characteristics:
    - universal

      Using the same structure to store any
      knowledge.
    
    - Able to learn symbols from the world and
      construct the deep symbolic networks
      automatically
      
      Utilises the fact that real world
      objects have been naturally separated by
      singularities.
    
    - Symbolic
    
      Has the capacity of performing causal
      deduction and generalization.
    
    - The symbols and the links between them
      are transparent to us
    
      Thus we will know what it has learned or
      not - which is the key for the security
      of an AI system.
    
    - Its transparency enables it to learn
      with relatively small data.
    
    - Its knowledge can be accumulated.
    
    - It is more friendly to unsupervised
      learning than DNN.
    
    We present the details of the model, the
    algorithm powering its automatic learning
    ability, and describe its usefulness in
    different use cases.

    Regards the blessings of scale as the
    secret of AGI: intelligence is ‘just’
    simple neural units & learning algorithms
    applied to diverse experiences at a
    (currently) unreachable scale.
