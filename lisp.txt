ASDF
asdf
    It's like make.

    Not a tool to build or run Common Lisp
    software from the Unix command-line. For
    that, you want cl-launch, buildapp, or
    roswell.

combinations
    combinations.cl =(echo -n "hi\nyo") =(echo -n "1\n2")

ensure-lisp
    00:32 < makomo> libertyprime: your LIFT-TO-LIST is Alexandria's ENSURE-LIST

apply
    Use apply when I want to expand a list to be the arguments for another function.
        ,@
        apply

cdr
    Pronounced "could-er".

dotted pair notation
    '(1 2 3)
    is written as:
    '(1 . (2 . (3 . nil)))

    They are equivalent.

    `(1 2)
    is written as:
    '(1 . (2))
