Decentralized finance
DeFi
    The nickname of financial smart contracts,
    decentralized applications (DApps), and
    protocols built on Ethereum.
    
    Financial DApps are the hottest use case
    of Ethereum at the given moment.

block height
    The block height of a particular block is
    defined as the number of blocks preceding
    it in the blockchain.

    A blockchain contains a series of blocks,
    hence the name blockchain.

    The total height of the blockchain is
    taken to be the height of the most recent
    block, or the highest block, in the chain.

Ethereum
    [cryptocurrency]
    [blockchain system]

    Based on the use of tokens, which can be
    bought, sold, or traded.
    
token
    Represent a diverse range of digital
    assets, such as vouchers, IOUs, or even
    real-world, tangible objects.
    
    Essentially, Ethereum tokens are smart
    contracts that make use of the Ethereum
    blockchain.

ERC-20
    One of the most significant tokens is
    called ERC-20, which has emerged as the
    technical standard used for all smart
    contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for
    token implementation.

    Plenty of well-known digital currencies
    use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker
    (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur
    (REP), and OmiseGO (OMG).

    ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to
    bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other
    cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are
    blockchain-based assets that have value
    and can be sent and received.
    
    The primary difference is that instead of
    running on their own blockchain, ERC-20
    tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.
