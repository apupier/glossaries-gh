Decentralized finance
DeFi
    The nickname of financial smart contracts,
    decentralized applications (DApps), and
    protocols built on Ethereum.
    
    Financial DApps are the hottest use case
    of Ethereum at the given moment.

block height
    The block height of a particular block is
    defined as the number of blocks preceding
    it in the blockchain.

    A blockchain contains a series of blocks,
    hence the name blockchain.

    The total height of the blockchain is
    taken to be the height of the most recent
    block, or the highest block, in the chain.

Ethereum
    [cryptocurrency]
    [blockchain system]

    Based on the use of tokens, which can be
    bought, sold, or traded.
    
token
    Represent a diverse range of digital
    assets, such as vouchers, IOUs, or even
    real-world, tangible objects.
    
    Essentially, Ethereum tokens are smart
    contracts that make use of the Ethereum
    blockchain.

    Many Web3 developers have chosen to build
    dapps because of Ethereum's inherent
    decentralization:

    - Anyone who is on the network has
      permission to use the service â€“ or in
      other words, permission isn't required.
    - No one can block you or deny you access
      to the service.
    - Payments are built in via the native
      token, ether (ETH).
    - Ethereum is turing-complete, meaning you
      can pretty much program anything.

ERC-20
    https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

    One of the most significant tokens is
    called ERC-20, which has emerged as the
    technical standard used for all smart
    contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for
    token implementation.

    Plenty of well-known digital currencies
    use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker
    (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur
    (REP), and OmiseGO (OMG).

    ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to
    bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other
    cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are
    blockchain-based assets that have value
    and can be sent and received.
    
    The primary difference is that instead of
    running on their own blockchain, ERC-20
    tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.

    A standard for Fungible Tokens.

    Have a property that makes each Token be
    exactly the same (in type and value) of
    another Token.
    
    For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just
    like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and
    will always be equal to all the other
    Tokens.

    If a Smart Contract implements the
    following methods and events it can be
    called an ERC-20 Token Contract and, once
    deployed, it will be responsible to keep
    track of the created tokens on Ethereum.

        function name() public view returns (string)
        function symbol() public view returns (string)
        function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
        function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
        function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
        function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
        function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
        function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
        function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
        event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
        event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)

Non-fungible tokens
NFT
    Digital assets that represent a wide range
    of unique tangible and intangible items,
    from collectible sports cards to virtual
    real estate and even digital sneakers.
