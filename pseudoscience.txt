extropy
    [pseudoscience]

    The pseudoscientific principle that life
    will expand indefinitely and in an
    orderly, progressive way throughout the
    entire universe by the means of human
    intelligence and technology.

    "a subculture of technocrats thriving in
    the US calls the life force ‘extropy’".

    First coined to serve as an antonym of
    entropy, substituting its en- element
    (representing the prepositional prefix ἐν
    (en), en, “in” in its Ancient Greek etymon
    ἐντροπία (entropía), entropia, “a turning
    towards”) with ex- (representing the
    Ancient Greek ἐξ (ex), ex, “out of”,
    “from”); because ἐξ (ex) takes the form ἐκ
    (ek) when prefixed to an element beginning
    with τ (t), the analogical spelling is
    ectropy (or, alternatively, ektropy), as
    if after the Ancient Greek *ἐκτροπία
    (ektropía, “a turning out of”).

Memetics
    The study of information and culture based
    on an analogy with Darwinian evolution.
    
    Proponents describe memetics as an
    approach to evolutionary models of
    cultural information transfer.
    
    Memetics describes how an idea can
    propagate successfully, but doesn't
    necessarily imply a concept is factual.
