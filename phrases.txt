    A tale told in folklore, to warn its
    listener of a danger.

    cautionary tale, though they can be
    introduced in a large variety of ways.
    
    First, a taboo or prohibition is stated:
    some act, location, or thing is said to be
    dangerous.
    
    Then, the narrative itself is told:
    someone disregarded the warning and
    performed the forbidden act.
    
    Finally, the violator comes to an
    unpleasant fate, which is frequently
    related in expansive and grisly detail.
