    [#semantic web]

    Structured data which is interlinked with
    other data so it becomes more useful
    through semantic queries.
    
    It builds upon standard Web technologies
    such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather
    than using them to serve web pages only
    for human readers, it extends them to
    share information in a way that can be
    read automatically by computers.
    
    Part of the vision of linked data is for
    the Internet to become a global database.
    
    Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World
    Wide Web Consortium (W3C), coined the term
    in a 2006 design note about the Semantic
    Web project.
    
    Linked data may also be open data, in
    which case it is usually described as
    linked open data (LOD).

Linked Data principles
    [#semantic web]

    - There must be resolvable http:// (or
      https://) URIs.

    - They must resolve, with or without
      content negotiation, to RDF data in one
      of the popular RDF formats (RDFa,
      RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples).

    - The dataset must contain at least 1000
      triples. (Hence, your FOAF file most
      likely does not qualify.)

    - The dataset must be connected via RDF
      links to a dataset that is already in
      the diagram. This means, either your
      dataset must use URIs from the other
      dataset, or vice versa. We arbitrarily
      require at least 50 links.

    - Access of the entire dataset must be
      possible via RDF crawling, via an RDF
      dump, or via a SPARQL endpoint.
