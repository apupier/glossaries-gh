Polanyi's Paradox
    [theory]

    We can know more than we can tell.
    
    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    and capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our explicit understanding.

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform but cannot verbalize the rules or
    procedures behind it.
    
    This "self-ignorance" is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to face recognition.
    
    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks.
    
    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of AI and
    automation, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming.
    
    Overcomed by recent advances in ML, some
    technological optimists argue.
    
    Instead of relaying on programmerâ€™s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to learn tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, and applied statistics on
    their own.
    
    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    examples without human assistance, they
    are no longer limited by those rules
    tacitly applied but not explicitly
    understood by humans.
