Axiology
    The philosophical study of value.
    
    It is either the collective term for
    ethics and aesthetics, philosophical
    fields that depend crucially on notions of
    worth, or the foundation for these fields,
    and thus similar to value theory and meta-
    ethics.

Ontology
    The branch of philosophy that studies
    concepts such as existence, being,
    becoming, and reality.
    
    It includes the questions of how entities
    are grouped into basic categories and
    which of these entities exist on the most
    fundamental level.

Epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature of
    knowledge, epistemic justification, the
    rationality of belief, and various related
    issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered one of the four
    main branches of philosophy, along with
    ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Polanyi's Paradox
    [theory]

    We can know more than we can tell.
    
    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    and capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our explicit understanding.

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform but cannot verbalize the rules or
    procedures behind it.
    
    This "self-ignorance" is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to face recognition.
    
    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks.
    
    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of AI and
    automation, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming.
    
    Overcomed by recent advances in ML, some
    technological optimists argue.
    
    Instead of relaying on programmerâ€™s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to learn tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, and applied statistics on
    their own.
    
    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    examples without human assistance, they
    are no longer limited by those rules
    tacitly applied but not explicitly
    understood by humans.
