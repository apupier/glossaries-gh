déjà vu
    This is the term in psychology that means
    the feeling of having previously
    experienced an event or place actually
    being encountered for the first time.
    
    It is the same as the French phrase déjà
    vu which can be translated as "seen
    before".
    
    In parapsychology the same term is used
    similarly to precognition, which means
    knowing something and being able to
    describe it before you encounter it.

ineffable
    Too great or extreme to be expressed or
    described in words.

    "the ineffable mysteries of the soul"

    The inability to understand one's own
    incompetence leads to inflated self-
    assessment.

    An illusory superiority that people
    believe (suffer from) in.
    
    This happens because of misjudging their
    cognitive abilities as greater, than it
    actually is.

    A cognitive bias in which people
    mistakenly assess their cognitive ability
    as greater than it is.
    
    It is related to the cognitive bias of
    illusory superiority and comes from the
    inability of people to recognize their
    lack of ability.

    Understands the needs of other intelligent
    entities.

    knowledge, etc. - to oneself, and to
    others, and to understand that others have
    beliefs, desires, intentions, and
    perspectives that are different from one's
    own.

    Great apes possess the “theory of mind,”
    which means they can attribute mental
    states to themselves and others, and they
    can also understand that others may
    believe different information than they
    do.

    their actions and behaviors.
    
    Social psychology states that attribution
    is the process by which individuals
    explain the causes of behavior and events
    as being either external or internal.
    
    Models to explain this process are called
    attribution theory.
