cognitive load
    Refers to the used amount of working
    memory resources.
    
    Cognitive load theory differentiates
    cognitive load into three types:
    intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Dunning-Kruger Effect
    The inability to understand one's own
    incompetence leads to inflated self-
    assessment.

    An illusory superiority that people
    believe (suffer from) in.
    
    This happens because of misjudging their
    cognitive abilities as greater, than it
    actually is.

    A cognitive bias in which people
    mistakenly assess their cognitive ability
    as greater than it is.
    
    It is related to the cognitive bias of
    illusory superiority and comes from the
    inability of people to recognize their
    lack of ability.

Theory of mind
    [#ai]
    [#psychology]
    [#philosophy]

    Understands the needs of other intelligent
    entities.

    The ability to attribute mental states -
    beliefs, intents, desires, emotions,
    knowledge, etc. - to oneself, and to
    others, and to understand that others have
    beliefs, desires, intentions, and
    perspectives that are different from one's
    own.

    Great apes possess the “theory of mind,”
    which means they can attribute mental
    states to themselves and others, and they
    can also understand that others may
    believe different information than they
    do.

Schizoid personality disorder
    An uncommon condition in which people
    avoid social activities and consistently
    shy away from interaction with others.
    
    They also have a limited range of
    emotional expression.

resentment
    A complex, multilayered emotion that has
    been described as a mixture of
    disappointment, disgust, anger, and fear.

    Other psychologists consider it a mood or
    as a secondary emotion that can be
    elicited in the face of insult and/or
    injury.
