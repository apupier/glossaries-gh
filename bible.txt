rivers of Eden
    Genesis 2:10–14 lists four rivers in
    association with the garden of Eden:
    
    Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel (the Tigris), and
    Phirat (the Euphrates).
    
    It also refers to the land of
    Cush—translated/interpreted as Ethiopia,
    but thought by some to equate to Cossaea,
    a Greek name for the land of the Kassites.

Havilah
    Friedrich Delitzsch located the land of
    Havilah in the Syrian Desert, west and
    south of the Euphrates. P. Haupt, who
    regarded the Pishon as the belt of water
    formed by the Kerkha, Persian Gulf, and
    Red Sea, identified Havilah with Arabia.
