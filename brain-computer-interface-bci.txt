mammalian neocortex
    Neural decoding research generally centers
    around this.

Reconstruction
    [#neural decoding]

    Ability of the researcher to predict what
    sensory stimuli the subject is receiving
    based purely on neuron action potentials.

neural decoding
    [#neuroscienc]
    [field of study]

    The hypothetical reconstruction of sensory
    and other stimuli from information that
    has already been encoded and represented
    in the brain by networks of neurons.
    
    Main goal:
        To characterize how the electrical
        activity of neurons elicit activity
        and responses in the brain.
