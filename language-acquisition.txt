Mean length of utterance
MLU
    A measure of linguistic productivity in
    children.
    
    It is traditionally calculated by
    collecting 100 utterances spoken by a
    child and dividing the number of morphemes
    by the number of utterances.
    
    A higher MLU is taken to indicate a higher
    level of language proficiency.
