RTT
Real Time Transfer
    https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/

    With RTT it is possible to output
    information from the target
    microcontroller as well as sending input
    to the application at a very high speed
    without affecting the target's real time
    behavior.
    
    SEGGER RTT can be used with any J-Link
    model and any supported target processor
    which allows background memory access,
    which are Cortex-M and RX targets.
    
    RTT supports multiple channels in both
    directions, up to the host and down to the
    target, which can be used for different
    purposes and provide the most possible
    freedom to the user.
