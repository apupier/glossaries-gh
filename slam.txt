estimator
    Examples:
    - Kalman filter

linear-Gaussian model
    A Bayes net where all the variables are
    Gaussian, and each variable's mean is
    linear in the values of its parents.
    
    They are widely used because they support
    efficient inference.
    
    Linear dynamical systems are an important
    special case.

particle filter
    [bayesian filter]

    An extension of Bayesian filter.

state estimation
    [problem]

    - Estimate the map and robot's pose
    - Bayes filter is one tool for state
      estimation

    Steps:
    - Prediction
    - Correlation

Kalman Filter
    [type/one implementation of the bayes filter]

    Realises the steps for state estimation:
    - Prediction
    - Correlation

Kalman Filter Distribution

pose
    The pose of a robot tells us location of
    the robot in either two or three
    dimensions and also its orientation.
    
    That is, in what direction is it facing.
    
    For mobile robots, the pose can be a
    simple three element vector, but for arm-
    based robots, we often use a matrix to
    describe the pose.

variability
scatter
spread
dispersion
Statistical dispersion
    [statistics]

    Dispersion is the extent to which a
    distribution is stretched or squeezed.
    
    Measures of statistical dispersion:
    - variance,
    - standard deviation, and
    - interquartile range.

covariance
    A measure of the joint variability of two
    random variables.
    
    If the greater values of one variable
    mainly correspond with the greater values
    of the other variable, and the same holds
    for the lesser values, the covariance is
    positive.

covariance matrix
auto-covariance matrix
dispersion matrix
variance matrix
varianceâ€“covariance matrix
    A square matrix giving the covariance
    between each pair of elements of a given
    random vector.

marginal distribution
    [#probability theory]

    The marginal distribution of a subset of a
    collection of random variables is the
    probability distribution of the variables
    contained in the subset.
    
    It gives the probabilities of various
    values of the variables in the subset
    without reference to the values of the
    other variables.

    Lingo:
    "marginal distribution over X"

conditional distribution
    A probability distribution for a sub-
    population.
    
    In other words, it shows the probability
    that a randomly selected item in a sub-
    population has a characteristic you're
    interested in.

joint probability distribution
Bivariate Distribution, n=2.
    Given random variables X,Y,..., that are
    defined on a probability space, the joint
    probability distribution for X,Y,... is a
    probability distribution that gives the
    probability that each of X,Y,... falls in
    any particular range or discrete set of
    values specified for that variable.

    Gives the probability that each of X, Y
    falls in any particular ranger or discrete
    set of values specified.

    In the case of 2 variablese this is called
    a bivariate distribution.
