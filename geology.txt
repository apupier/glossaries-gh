Gypsum
    A soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium
    sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical
    formula CaSO.4Â·2H2O.
    
    It is widely mined and is used as a
    fertilizer and as the main constituent in
    many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk
    chalk, and drywall.

    Present on the Martian surface.

ventifact
    A rock that has been abraded, pitted,
    etched, grooved, or polished by wind-
    driven sand or ice crystals.

serpentinization
    A processes whereby rock (usually
    ultramafic) is changed, with the addition
    of water into the crystal structure of the
    minerals found within the rock.
    
    A common example is the serpentinization
    of peridotite (or dunite) into
    serpentinite (the metamorphic equivalent).

alluvium
    A deposit of clay, silt, sand, and gravel
    left by flowing streams in a river valley
    or delta, typically producing fertile
    soil.

rift
    A linear zone where the lithosphere is
    being pulled apart and is an example of
    extensional tectonics.
    
    Typical rift features are a central linear
    downfaulted depression, called a graben,
    or more commonly a half-graben with normal
    faulting and rift-flank uplifts mainly on
    one side.
