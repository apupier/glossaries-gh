burning
    Two atoms or molecules will combine and
    release energy.

    Usually one of the two molecules is oxygen
    or something else chemically like it
    called an oxidizer. 

    The simplest burning process is the
    burning of hydrogen.

    Water is burnt hydrogen.

donor atom
the donor atom
    The/an atom within the ligand that is
    attached to the Lewis acid centre.
    
    The coordination number is the number of

    A macrocycle has multiple donor atoms.

kinetics
Chemical kinetics
reaction kinetics
    The branch of physical chemistry that is
    concerned with understanding the rates of
    chemical reactions.
    
    It is to be contrasted with
    thermodynamics, which deals with the
    direction in which a process occurs but in
    itself tells nothing about its rate.
    
    Chemical kinetics includes investigations
    of how experimental conditions influence
    the speed of a chemical reaction and yield
    information about the reaction's mechanism
    and transition states, as well as the
    construction of mathematical models that
    also can describe the characteristics of a
    chemical reaction.

Glass
    A liquid or solid depending on the
    temperature -- a very viscous (but not
    sticky) one. That's not a myth, but the
    stained glass windows analogy is.

    An amorphous solid.

    At room temperature, glass molecules can't
    slide past each other, so it's a solid.

    There is structural change that causes
    glass to turn into a liquid at higher
    temperatures.
