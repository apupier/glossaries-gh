action potential
    Defined as a sudden, fast, transitory, and
    propagating change of the resting membrane
    potential.

    Only neurons and muscle cells are capable
    of generating an action potential; that
    property is called the excitability.

    An action potential occurs when the
    membrane potential of a specific cell
    location rapidly rises and falls: this
    depolarization then causes adjacent
    locations to similarly depolarize. 

cytoskeleton
    A microscopic network of protein filaments
    and tubules in the cytoplasm of many
    living cells, giving them shape and
    coherence.
    
microtubules
    Polymers of tubulin that form part of the
    cytoskeleton and provide structure and
    shape to eukaryotic cells.
    
    Microtubules can grow as long as 50
    micrometres and are highly dynamic.
    
    The outer diameter of a microtubule is
    between 23 and 27 nm while the inner
    diameter is between 11 and 15 nm.

eukaryotic cells
    /home/shane/glossaries/microbiology.txt

    Contains membrane-bound organelles such as
    a nucleus, mitochondria, and an
    endoplasmic reticulum.
    
    Organisms based on the eukaryotic cell
    include protozoa, fungi, plants, and
    animals.

fungi
    Fungi are not plants.
    
    Living things are organized for study into
    large, basic groups called kingdoms.
    
    Fungi were listed in the Plant Kingdom for
    many years.
    
    Then scientists learned that fungi show a
    closer relation to animals, but are unique
    and separate life forms.

tubulin
    The protein that polymerizes into long
    chains or filaments that form
    microtubules, hollow fibers which serve as
    a skeletal system for living cells.

mitochondria
    A double-membrane-bound organelle found in
    most eukaryotic organisms.
    
    Some cells in some multicellular organisms
    lack mitochondria.
