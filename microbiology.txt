cytoskeleton
    A microscopic network of protein filaments
    and tubules in the cytoplasm of many
    living cells, giving them shape and
    coherence.
    
microtubules
    Polymers of tubulin that form part of the
    cytoskeleton and provide structure and
    shape to eukaryotic cells.
    
    Microtubules can grow as long as 50
    micrometres and are highly dynamic.
    
    The outer diameter of a microtubule is
    between 23 and 27 nm while the inner
    diameter is between 11 and 15 nm.
