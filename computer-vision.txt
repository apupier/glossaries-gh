two view matching
wide baseline stereo
    A basic task needed for 3D reconstruction
    and all things like it.
    
    You get two or more images and you should
    answer if they are depicting the same
    object.
    
    If yes — also output pixel or region
    correspondences between images and
    geometrical relations between them, see an
    example here.

Fréchet Inception Distance
FID
    May be used for filtering images.

    FID is a metric of similarity between
    images.
