AWS Perspective
    [tool]

    https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-perspective/

    Quickly visualizes AWS Cloud workloads as
    architecture diagrams.
    
    You can use the solution to build,
    customize, and share detailed workload
    visualizations based on live data from
    AWS.
    
    This solution works by maintaining an
    inventory of the AWS resources across your
    accounts and Regions, mapping
    relationships between them, and displaying
    them in a web user interface (web UI).
    
    When making changes to a resource, AWS
    Perspective saves you time by providing a
    link to the resource in the AWS Management
    Console.

AWS CloudFormation
    Provides a common language for you to
    model and provision AWS and third party
    application resources in your cloud
    environment.
    
    AWS CloudFormation allows you to use
    programming languages or a simple text
    file to model and provision, in an
    automated and secure manner, all the
    resources needed for your applications
    across all regions and accounts.
    
    This gives you a single source of truth
    for your AWS and third party resources.

Amazon EC2

Amazon EBS

AMI
Amazon Machine Image
    A special type of virtual appliance that
    is used to create a VM within the Amazon
    Elastic Compute Cloud ("EC2").
    
    It serves as the basic unit of deployment
    for services delivered using EC2.

stateless
    State is managed by another system.
    
    On AWS, this can be DynamoDB, RDS, S3, or
    other storage services.
    
    Managing a stateless system is less
    complex than managing a stateful system.
    
    You can terminate single instances at any
    time without loosing data.

Elastic Load Balancing
ELB
    Achieve fault tolerance for any
    application by ensuring scalability,
    performance, and security.

    Automatically distributes incoming
    application traffic across multiple
    targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances,
    containers, IP addresses, and Lambda
    functions.
    
    It can handle the varying load of your
    application traffic in a single
    Availability Zone or across multiple
    Availability Zones.
    
    Elastic Load Balancing offers three types
    of load balancers that all feature the
    high availability, automatic scaling, and
    robust security necessary to make your
    applications fault tolerant.

Application Load Balancer
ALB
    Best suited for load balancing of HTTP and
    HTTPS traffic and provides advanced
    request routing targeted at the delivery
    of modern application architectures,
    including microservices and containers.
    
    Operating at the individual request level
    (Layer 7), Application Load Balancer
    routes traffic to targets within Amazon
    VPC based on the content of the request.

Network Load Balancer
NLB
    Best suited for load balancing of TCP, UDP
    and TLS traffic where extreme performance
    is required.
    
    Operating at the connection level (Layer
    4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic
    to targets within Amazon VPC and is
    capable of handling millions of requests
    per second while maintaining ultra-low
    latencies.
    
    Network Load Balancer is also optimized to
    handle sudden and volatile traffic
    patterns.

Classic Load Balancer
CLB
    Provides basic load balancing across
    multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates
    at both the request level and connection
    level.
    
    Classic Load Balancer is intended for
    applications that were built within the
    EC2-Classic network.

Spot fleet

    This is the answer to capacity problems.

ECR
Amazon Elastic Container Registry
    [#aws]

    A fully-managed Docker container registry
    that makes it easy for developers to
    store, manage, and deploy Docker

ECS
Elastic Container Service
    Fully managed container orchestration
    service.
    
    Customers such as Duolingo, Samsung, GE,
    and Cookpad use ECS to run their most
    sensitive and mission critical
    applications because of its security,
    reliability, and scalability.
    
    ECS is a great choice to run containers
    for several reasons.
    
    First, you can choose to run your ECS
    clusters using AWS Fargate, which is
    serverless compute for containers.
    
    Fargate removes the need to provision and
    manage servers, lets you specify and pay
    for resources per application, and
    improves security through application
    isolation by design.
    
    Second, ECS is used extensively within
    Amazon to power services such as Amazon
    SageMaker, AWS Batch, Amazon Lex, and
    Amazon.com’s recommendation engine,
    ensuring ECS is tested extensively for
    security, reliability, and availability.

AWS Marketplace
    A digital catalog with thousands of
    software listings from independent
    software vendors that make it easy to
    find, test, buy, and deploy software that
    runs on AWS.

Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service
s3
    A service offered by Amazon Web Services
    that provides object storage through a web
    service interface.
    
    Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage
    infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run
    its global e-commerce network.

Bastion Server
Bastion Host
    Use to controlling network access to EC2
    Instances.

    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/architecture.html

Reserved Instance
    A reservation of resources and capacity,
    for either one or three years, for a
    particular Availability Zone within a
    region.
    
    Unlike on-demand, when you purchase a
    reservation, you commit to paying for all
    of the hours of the 1- or 3-year term; in
    exchange, the hourly rate is lowered
    significantly.

Standard Reserved Instances
    Provide you with a significant discount
    (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance
    pricing, and can be purchased for a 1-year
    or 3-year term.
    
    Customers have the flexibility to change
    the Availability Zone, the instance size,
    and networking type of their Standard
    Reserved Instances.

Availability Zone
    A logical data center in a region
    available for use by any AWS customer.
    
    Each zone in a region has redundant and
    separate power, networking and
    connectivity to reduce the likelihood of
    two zones failing simultaneously.
    
    A common misconception is that a single
    zone equals a single data center.

AWS Lambda
    An event-driven, serverless computing
    platform provided by Amazon as a part of
    Amazon Web Services.
    
    It is a computing service that runs code
    in response to events and automatically
    manages the computing resources required
    by that code.
    
    It was introduced in November 2014.

DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB
    A key-value and document database that
    delivers single-digit millisecond
    performance at any scale.
    
    It's a fully managed, multiregion,
    multimaster, durable database with built-
    in security, backup and restore, and in-
    memory caching for internet-scale
    applications.

SAM
    [cloud formation]

    An AWS deploy tool on top of cloud
    formation.

AWS Fargate
Fargate
    Amazon's container service.

    A serverless compute engine for containers
    that works with both Amazon Elastic
    Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic
    k8s Service (EKS).
    
    Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on
    building your applications.
    
    Fargate removes the need to provision and
    manage servers, lets you specify and pay
    for resources per application, and
    improves security through application
    isolation by design.
    
    Fargate allocates the right amount of
    compute, eliminating the need to choose
    instances and scale cluster capacity.
    
    You only pay for the resources required to
    run your containers, so there is no over-
    provisioning and paying for additional
    servers.
    
    Fargate runs each task or pod in its own
    kernel providing the tasks and pods their
    own isolated compute environment.
    
    This enables your application to have
    workload isolation and improved security
    by design.
    
    This is why customers such as Vanguard,
    Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have
    chosen to run their mission critical
    applications on Fargate.

AWS CodeBuild
    Fully managed CI service that compiles
    source code, runs tests, and produces
    software packages that are ready to
    deploy.
    
    With CodeBuild, you don’t need to
    provision, manage, and scale your own
    build servers.
    
    CodeBuild scales continuously and
    processes multiple builds concurrently, so
    your builds are not left waiting in a
    queue.
    
    You can get started quickly by using
    prepackaged build environments, or you can
    create custom build environments that use
    your own build tools.
    
    With CodeBuild, you are charged by the
    minute for the compute resources you use.
