Atrus
    In the ruins of D'ni Atrus plays the
    central character in the Book of Atrus,
    the prequel to the original Myst game.
    This book shows Atrus growing up, first in
    the Cleft with his grandmother, then as he
    learns to write Ages with his father.

Gehn
    Came back to the cleft when Atrus was
    fourteen and took the boy from his
    grandmother.
    
    He led Atrus down into the underground
    D'ni capital and told him about his
    heritage.
    
    Living on the island of K'veer he taught
    Atrus to write, and how to travel back and
    forth through Ages safely.
    
    By the end of his teen years, Atrus came
    to realize that Gehn was a madman.
